# Hypertrade

A personal market terminal for tracking crypto assets, simulating allocation branches against historical data, and monitoring sector dynamics.

## Setup

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

```bash
bun run dev       # Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
bun run dev:api   # API server (localhost:8787)
```

## Build

```bash
bun run build
```

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel + Supabase. Set environment variables from `.env.example` in Vercel project settings.

## Strategy engine (optional)

The `/strategies`, `/decisions` and `/governor` pages talk to the hyperion core
through the `/api/engine/*` proxy (`src/server/routes/engine.ts`), which forwards
to `${ENGINE_URL}/api/strategy/*` with `Authorization: Bearer ${ENGINE_TOKEN}`.

- `ENGINE_URL` — base URL of the hyperion core (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`).
  Unset: the proxy answers `503 { "error": "engine not configured" }` and the
  pages render their offline state.
- `ENGINE_TOKEN` — the core's API bearer token. Optional; omitted when unset.

Upstream failures surface as `502 { "error": "engine unreachable" }` (or
`"engine timeout"` after 10s). Wire types live in
`src/shared/strategy-protocol.ts`; fixtures under `src/shared/fixtures/strategy/`.
